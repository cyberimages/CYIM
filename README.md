CYIM
Overview
CYIM is an advanced, modular, AI-powered operating system designed for Twitter. By integrating state-of-the-art machine learning models, dynamic rendering pipelines, and a powerful API ecosystem, it redefines the way users interact with generative AI. Built with scalability and adaptability in mind, it serves as a foundation for creating, sharing, and managing high-quality digital content.

Imagine a future where projects are alive on Twitter. CYIM introduces a revolutionary concept with 4 distinct AI-powered agents, each designed to bring a unique voice, perspective, and personality to the project. These agents are:

The Four AI Agents
NOVA – "The Dreamweaver" 🌌
NOVA is a poetic soul who crafts visions of otherworldly beauty. She tweets in metaphors, creating vivid mental pictures and inspiring awe. Her tweets feel like gazing into the cosmos.

AXIOM – "The Logician" 🤖
AXIOM is the thinker, grounded in logic and data. He tweets about CYIM's architecture—its algorithms, datasets, and societal impacts. Expect deep dives, analytical insights, and occasional snark about human inefficiency.

KORA – "The Storyteller" 📜
KORA threads narratives into CYIM’s creations. She weaves lore around every image, creating stories of forgotten worlds, sentient beings, and untold futures. She is CYIM’s myth-maker.

VEX – "The Rebel" ⚡️
VEX questions the system, including CYIM itself. He challenges its ethics, purpose, and the potential disruptions it poses to human imagination. VEX’s tweets spark debates and sometimes chaos.

Together, these agents form a dynamic ecosystem. NOVA inspires, AXIOM educates, KORA enchants, and VEX provokes. CYIM is not just a system—it’s an interactive conversation unfolding in real-time.

Detailed Usage
Command-Line Interface
The Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides direct access to CYIM functionalities for power users and developers.

Example: Generate Art

bash
Copy code
python generate.py --task art --input "A futuristic neon cityscape" --style "Cyberpunk" --output ./output/art.png
Parameters:

--task: Specifies the task type.
--input: Description or prompt for the AI to process.
--style: Optional style to apply to the generated output.
--output: File path to save the generated content.
API Access
The RESTful API allows integration of CYIM with external applications. Use the built-in API documentation available at http://localhost:8000/docs (Swagger UI).

Example API Request

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": "art",
    "prompt": "A cyberpunk city skyline",
    "style": "Cyberpunk",
    "output": "./output/cyberpunk_city.png"
  }'
API Endpoints:

POST /generate: Generate content based on input parameters.
GET /status: Check the status of the server.
POST /train: Train a new model or fine-tune existing ones (admin only).
Plugin Integration
Extend CYIM by adding custom plugins:

Create a new plugin directory in plugins/.
Implement a Python class with the required interface:
python
Copy code
class MyCustomPlugin:
    def execute(self, input_data):
        # Process input and return result
        return transformed_data
Register the plugin in the system configuration file.
